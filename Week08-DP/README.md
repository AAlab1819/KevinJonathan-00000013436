# 433B - Kuriyama Mirai's Stones
We need to find the answers to Kuriyama Mirai's questions related to the stones.
So we'll need to store the cost of the stones in two different arrays, which one of them will be sorted according to the cheapest value.
The non-sorted array will be used to answer the first question type, while the sorted one is used to answer the other question type.
From that, we can answer Kuriyama Mirai's questions.

Time Complexity:

# 913C - Party Lemonade 
We need to determine the amount of roubles to be paid for our lemonade party.
So, we'll input the number of type and the liters for each bottle.
After that, we compare the values of the bottle if it's cheaper to buy 2 of the smaller type.
From that, we sum up the amount of liter with the price of the lemonade bottles.
